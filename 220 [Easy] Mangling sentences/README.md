[[2015-06-22] Challenge #220 [Easy] Mangling sentences](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/3aqvjn/20150622_challenge_220_easy_mangling_sentences/)

#Description

In this challenge, we are going to take a sentence and mangle it up by sorting the letters in each word. So, for instance, if you take the word "hello" and sort the letters in it, you get "ehllo". If you take the two words "hello world", and sort the letters in each word, you get "ehllo dlorw". 

#Inputs &amp;amp; outputs

##Input

The input will be a single line that is exactly one English sentence, starting with a capital letter and ending with a period

##Output

The output will be the same sentence with all the letters in each word sorted. Words that were capitalized in the input needs to be capitalized properly in the output, and any punctuation should remain at the same place as it started. So, for instance, "Dailyprogrammer" should become "Aadegilmmoprrry" (note the capital A), and "doesn't" should become "denos't".
