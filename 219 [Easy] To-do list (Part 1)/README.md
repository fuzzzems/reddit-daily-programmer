[[2015-06-15] Challenge #219 [Easy] To-do list (Part 1)](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/39ws1x/20150615_challenge_218_easy_todo_list_part_1/)

#Description

Todays challenge will be something slightly different! Atleast I think the challenge is meant to be for today? Wait, am I meant to even be submitting today? 

Okay maybe I need some help on organising my thoughts before I submit my challenge. A to-do list would be fine, just something so that I can organise my thoughts!

It should have the following basic functionality

* Add an item to the to-do list
* Delete a selected item from the to-do list
* And obviously, print out the list so I can see what to do!

#Formal Inputs &amp; Outputs

##Output description

Any output that is created should be user-friendly. When I'm viewing my to-do list, I should be able to easily discern one list item from another.

#Examples
Input:

    addItem('Take a shower');
    addItem('Go to work');
    viewList();

Output:

    Take a shower
    Go to work

Further Input:

    addItem('Buy a new phone');
    viewList();
    
Outputs:

    Take a shower
    Go to work
    Buy a new phone
#Finally

Have a good challenge idea?
